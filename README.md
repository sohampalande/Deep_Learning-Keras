# Sequential_Models_Deeplearn
This notebook follows a tutorial and walks in detail through all the steps of training a Sequential Model using artificial data using the Keras API. 
The data is first preprocessed and then used to train the model which is then validated against a cross-validation set 
and tested by predicting on artifical test data. 
The performance of the classification model is then evaluated by plotting a confusion matrix after which the model is saved.
